      # By default, both build (https://pypi.org/project/build/)
      # and cibuildwheel (https://pypi.org/project/cibuildwheel/) seem to try to compile for macOS 10.9
      # based on the wheel output names in the logs. However, C++17 seems to have introduced some alignment
      # for classes, which results in this error for the GzipReader class itself even without "alignas" being used:
      # > error: aligned allocation function of type 'void *(std::size_t, std::align_val_t)'
      # >        is only available on macOS 10.14 or newer
      # See also this discussion https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1274388
      #
      # In the end, 10.9 support should not be necessary anymore in almost 2023. Apple-support for that seems
      # to have stopped 2016-12-01 (https://endoflife.date/macos) and even support for 10.14, which was introduced
      # in 2019-09-24 has already stopped in 2021-10-25, so more than a year ago.
